INTRODUCTION :
An airline reservation system is part of the so-called passenger service systems, which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger. ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system. A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.
Today all persons are busy with their schedule and no one have time to make a trip for holidays with their family. And this Airline Reservation Process is very difficult to understand in General meaning. But we are providing a Solution for that Problem. This system provides a facility to easy access towards a customers and a real time users. They can easily connected through it and just 3 steps. There is no requirement for any type of Agent. We are giving a all this facility in one project Airline Reservation System. The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the "Departure city" and "Arrival city" for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight's details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc.

OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT:
The Airline Reservation System project is an implementation of a general Airline Ticketing website like Orbitz, which helps the customers to search the availability of flights,
book and cancel the flight tickets. This project also covers adding, deleting or modifying the customer details and flights. In general, this website would be designed to perform
like any other airline ticketing website available online.
